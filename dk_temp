Team,

 

      Last night the ESX host was brought back online and all the VM’s are up.

 

I have verified the DB servers and everything looked fine.

 

Below servers had some issue with the db,  I have taken care of them and all are online.

Thanks

Prabhu,

Thanks for the reply, I had assumed it was a host issue considering the random mix of servers.  I'll update the team and let them know that you are currently working on a resolution.

Thanks,

Hi Jeff,

 

    There is one ESX host down and we are working on it and updated the teams.

 

Below vm’s are on that host.    I will update once it is all resolved.
