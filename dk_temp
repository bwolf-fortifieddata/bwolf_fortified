Subject: RE: [Request received] Database failure

 

Hi Bill,

 

We executed “DK_SP_FXF_GET_CURRENCY_EXPOSURE_DATA” Procedure in Production by taking the parameters from the log file and found it took just a second to execute which had taken almost 10min in Production yesterday. We are still figuring out whether it is because of procedure or some database related issue.

However, we did some changes in this Proc. Please find the attached files and  let us know any further improvement we can do in it.

 

DK_SP_FXF_GET_CURRENCY_EXPOSURE_DATA @FromDate = '4/28/2018 12:00:00 AM'

,@ToDate = '4/28/2020 12:00:00 AM'

,@SearchCriteria = 'T'

,@Deal = 'NGF / DANISH BIOGAS'

 

Regards,

Pankaj Kumar
